High-Level AWS Deployment Steps
Phase 1: Prepare for Cloud Deployment

**Containerize Services**

Create Dockerfiles for each service
Build Docker images locally
Test with Docker Compose
Push images to Docker Hub/ECR


**Update Configuration for Cloud**

Replace localhost URLs with environment variables
Create AWS-specific application properties
Configure health checks and actuator endpoints



**Phase 2: AWS Infrastructure Setup**

Create VPC and Networking

Set up VPC with public/private subnets
Configure Internet Gateway and Route Tables
Create Security Groups for services


**Set up Load Balancer**

Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Configure Target Groups for each service
Set up listener rules for routing


**Database Setup (Optional)**

Create RDS instance (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Update services to use RDS instead of H2
Configure database security groups



**Phase 3: Container Orchestration**

Choose Deployment Method:

Option A: ECS (Elastic Container Service)

Create ECS cluster
Define task definitions
Create services with desired count


Option B: EKS (Kubernetes)

Create EKS cluster
Deploy using Kubernetes manifests


Option C: EC2 with Docker

Launch EC2 instances
Install Docker/Docker Compose
Deploy containers manually





**Phase 4: Service Discovery**

Remove Eureka (optional)

Use AWS Service Discovery instead
Or keep ALB for service communication
Configure services to find each other via DNS


Update Service URLs

Use ALB DNS names or service discovery
Configure environment variables for service endpoints



**Phase 5: Deploy and Test**

Deploy Infrastructure

Use CloudFormation or Terraform
Deploy in correct order (database → services → load balancer)


**Deploy Applications**

Register task definitions
Start ECS services
Verify all services are running


**Test End-to-End**

Test via ALB endpoints
Verify service-to-service communication
Check health endpoints



**Phase 6: Production Readiness**

Monitoring and Logging

Set up CloudWatch logs
Configure application metrics
Set up alerts


**Security**

Review security groups
Enable HTTPS with SSL certificates
Configure IAM roles properly


**Auto Scaling**

Configure ECS auto scaling
Set up ALB scaling policies



Estimated Timeline: 2-4 hours for basic deployment, 1-2 days for production-ready setup
